# Backend-Task-Manager
A simple Task Manager Backend built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides user authentication (signup &amp; login), JWT-based authorization, and CRUD operations for managing tasks (todos). The project uses bcrypt for password hashing, zod for input validation, and CORS for secure API communication.
